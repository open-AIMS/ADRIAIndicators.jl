abstract = {Structural complexity plays a key role in the functioning of coral reef ecosystems. Reef-building corals are major contributors to this complexity, providing shelter and food for numerous invertebrates and fish species. Both structural complexity and shelter capacity of reefscapes are determined by several components such as spurs and grooves, slope, caves and holes, vegetation and coral colonies. Quantifying the shelter capacity from coral colonies to reefscapes is a fundamental step to estimating ecosystem potential to support biodiversity. Here, we applied underwater photogrammetry to quantify shelter volumes provided by individual coral colonies. Overall, 120 3D models of coral colonies from branching, massive, columnar and tabular growth forms were studied. Three reefscapes were also 3D modeled. The study encompasses three Indo-Pacific Islands: Reunion, Europa and New Caledonia. At the colony level, measurements of diameter, planar area, surface and shelter volume were computed. At the reefscape, the diameter and planar area of each colony were extracted from orthomosaics and then used to estimate shelter capacity. Linear models had high accuracy for predicting shelter volume (a 3D metric) from 2D metrics: the diameter= 83.1%, R2= 0.95; the planar area= 87.5%, R2= 0.95 and the colony surface= 87.3%, R2= 0.96. The surface complexity and the shelter volume of the colonies allowed inferring the size of shelters provided by coral growth forms. Quantitative descriptors (i.e. relative percentage of shelter by growth form, the abundance of coral colonies, “Shannon-Shelter Index”) revealed reefscape-scale shelter differences. Our major finding is that planar area and diameter of coral colonies are satisfactory proxies for estimating shelter volume. These new proxies allow 2D metrics to quantify 3D shelter provision, which can support scientists and managers in conservation actions since such metrics are widely used in monitoring programs. Future investigations on the relationships between shelter provision and reef biodiversity will improve the understanding of these complex ecosystems.}

ABSTRACT={The 3D structure of individual coral colonies provides insights into their ecological functioning. While structure from motion techniques make it possible to reconstruct 3D models of coral colonies based on overlapping images, the extraction of relevant metrics of complexity in a reproducible way remains challenging. We present a method for the 3D reconstruction of coral colonies and the automatic extraction of eleven structural complexity metrics from 3D models using two user-friendly python scripts. The eleven complexity metrics are designed to capture aspects of complexity relating to the colony’s size and shape of the 3D structure that are related to their likely ecological function. We explored the potential ecological applications of some of these metrics using linear models, comparing aspects of complexity among colonies of different size, and morphotaxa (combined information on growth morphology and taxa). Our results showed that a metric as simple as colony diameter explained 95% of the variation in shelter provisioning capability when paired with information on colony morphotaxa. Further, the habitat provisioning of colonies of comparable size was similar among the seven morphotaxa examined. During the current period of rapid uptake of this accessible method among ecologists, the results of our study provide a basis to use data derived from 3D models to further explore the nuances of the relationship between structure and function of corals at the colony scale in a replicable and comparable way.}

abstract = {Three commonly used measures of diversity, Simpson's index, Shannon's entropy, and the total number of species, are related to Renyi's definition of a generalized entropy. A unified concept of diversity is presented, according to which there is a continuum of possible diversity measures. In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve. A new and plausible definition of evenness is derived.},
