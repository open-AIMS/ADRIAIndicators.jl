abstract = {Structural complexity plays a key role in the functioning of coral reef ecosystems. Reef-building corals are major contributors to this complexity, providing shelter and food for numerous invertebrates and fish species. Both structural complexity and shelter capacity of reefscapes are determined by several components such as spurs and grooves, slope, caves and holes, vegetation and coral colonies. Quantifying the shelter capacity from coral colonies to reefscapes is a fundamental step to estimating ecosystem potential to support biodiversity. Here, we applied underwater photogrammetry to quantify shelter volumes provided by individual coral colonies. Overall, 120 3D models of coral colonies from branching, massive, columnar and tabular growth forms were studied. Three reefscapes were also 3D modeled. The study encompasses three Indo-Pacific Islands: Reunion, Europa and New Caledonia. At the colony level, measurements of diameter, planar area, surface and shelter volume were computed. At the reefscape, the diameter and planar area of each colony were extracted from orthomosaics and then used to estimate shelter capacity. Linear models had high accuracy for predicting shelter volume (a 3D metric) from 2D metrics: the diameter= 83.1%, R2= 0.95; the planar area= 87.5%, R2= 0.95 and the colony surface= 87.3%, R2= 0.96. The surface complexity and the shelter volume of the colonies allowed inferring the size of shelters provided by coral growth forms. Quantitative descriptors (i.e. relative percentage of shelter by growth form, the abundance of coral colonies, “Shannon-Shelter Index”) revealed reefscape-scale shelter differences. Our major finding is that planar area and diameter of coral colonies are satisfactory proxies for estimating shelter volume. These new proxies allow 2D metrics to quantify 3D shelter provision, which can support scientists and managers in conservation actions since such metrics are widely used in monitoring programs. Future investigations on the relationships between shelter provision and reef biodiversity will improve the understanding of these complex ecosystems.}

ABSTRACT={The 3D structure of individual coral colonies provides insights into their ecological functioning. While structure from motion techniques make it possible to reconstruct 3D models of coral colonies based on overlapping images, the extraction of relevant metrics of complexity in a reproducible way remains challenging. We present a method for the 3D reconstruction of coral colonies and the automatic extraction of eleven structural complexity metrics from 3D models using two user-friendly python scripts. The eleven complexity metrics are designed to capture aspects of complexity relating to the colony’s size and shape of the 3D structure that are related to their likely ecological function. We explored the potential ecological applications of some of these metrics using linear models, comparing aspects of complexity among colonies of different size, and morphotaxa (combined information on growth morphology and taxa). Our results showed that a metric as simple as colony diameter explained 95% of the variation in shelter provisioning capability when paired with information on colony morphotaxa. Further, the habitat provisioning of colonies of comparable size was similar among the seven morphotaxa examined. During the current period of rapid uptake of this accessible method among ecologists, the results of our study provide a basis to use data derived from 3D models to further explore the nuances of the relationship between structure and function of corals at the colony scale in a replicable and comparable way.}

abstract = {Three commonly used measures of diversity, Simpson's index, Shannon's entropy, and the total number of species, are related to Renyi's definition of a generalized entropy. A unified concept of diversity is presented, according to which there is a continuum of possible diversity measures. In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve. A new and plausible definition of evenness is derived.},

abstract = {Abstract Cumulative impacts assessments on marine ecosystems have been hindered by the difficulty of collecting environmental data and identifying drivers of community dynamics beyond local scales. On coral reefs, an additional challenge is to disentangle the relative influence of multiple drivers that operate at different stages of coral ontogeny. We integrated coral life history, population dynamics, and spatially explicit environmental drivers to assess the relative and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors across 2,300 km of the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Using literature data, we characterized relationships between coral life history processes (reproduction, larval dispersal, recruitment, growth, and mortality) and environmental variables. We then simulated coral demographics and stressor impacts at the organism (coral colony) level on >3,800 individual reefs linked by larval connectivity and exposed to temporally and spatially realistic regimes of acute (crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, cyclones, and mass coral bleaching) and chronic (water-quality) stressors. Model simulations produced a credible reconstruction of recent (2008–2020) coral trajectories consistent with monitoring observations, while estimating the impacts of each stressor at reef and regional scales. Overall, simulated coral populations declined by one-third across the GBR, from an average of ~29\% to ~19\% hard coral cover. By 2020, <20\% of the GBR had coral cover higher than 30\%, a status of reef health corroborated by scarce and sparsely distributed monitoring data. Reef-wide annual rates of coral mortality were driven by bleaching (48\%) ahead of cyclones (41\%) and starfish predation (11\%). Beyond the reconstructed status and trends, the model enabled the emergence of complex interactions that compound the effects of multiple stressors while promoting a mechanistic understanding of coral cover dynamics. Drivers of coral cover growth were identified; notably, water quality (suspended sediments) was estimated to delay recovery for at least 25\% of inshore reefs. Standardized rates of coral loss and recovery allowed the integration of all cumulative impacts to determine the equilibrium cover for each reef. This metric, combined with maps of impacts, recovery potential, water-quality thresholds, and reef state metrics, facilitates strategic spatial planning and resilience-based management across the GBR.},

abstract={Natural systems exhibit high spatial variability across multiple scales. Models that can capture ecosystem dynamics across space and time by explicitly incorporating major biological mechanisms are crucial, both for management and for ecological insight. In the case of coral reef systems, much focus has been on modelling variability between reefs, despite substantial variability also existing within reefs. We developed C{\textasciitilde}scape, a coral metacommunity modelling framework that integrates the demography of corals with population-level responses to physical and environmental spatial layers, to facilitate spatiotemporal predictions of coral dynamics across reefs at fine (100s of metres to kilometres) scales. We used satellite-derived habitat maps to modulate community growth spatially, as a proxy for the many interacting physical and environmental factors---e.g., depth, light, wave exposure, temperature, and substrate type---that drive within-reef variability in coral demography. With a case study from the Great Barrier Reef, we demonstrate the model's capability for producing hindcasts of coral cover dynamics and show that overlooking within-reef variability may lead to misleading conclusions about metacommunity dynamics. C{\textasciitilde}scape provides a valuable framework for exploring a range of management and restoration scenarios at relevant spatial scales.},

abstract = {Healthy coral reefs hold significant value to society, not just from industries such as tourism or fishing, but by their very existence. These so-called ‘non-use benefits’ are increasingly endangered as the health of coral reefs faces escalating threats from climate change. Yet, current observation and modelling tools that help guide reef intervention efforts typically do not provide guidance on how the impact of management actions on reef ecology flows through to changes in non-use benefits. Here, we demonstrate how ecological metrics, as measured by existing reef observation or modelling tools, can be translated to an economic valuation of non-use benefits from conservation actions on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Using our framework, we find that each additional square kilometre of reef maintained in ‘good’ or ‘very good’ condition by an intervention generates a present value of ~$4.7 million (2025 Australian dollars) in non-use benefits for the Australian public. Rigorous and transparent valuation of how reef ecosystem respond to conservation actions is critical, given the rapid rise of private investment in the nature repair market. The framework presented here offers an approach that leverages existing models and expert knowledge and is designed for application to any reef conservation action whose ecological benefits can be measured or modelled.},
